      <h2>DBC Pairing and Feedback</h2>

      <p>I really enjoyed doing paired-programming with other DBC students. It seemed twice efficient when we banged our heads together at the same problem. Also, in terms of solving techniques, it was nice to see other approaches to the same problem. This helped me understand other syntaxes that weren't as clear to me before. At times it was difficult if we weren't on the same page since everything was over google hangouts but we were able to tackle this by encouraging each other to keep talking through the problem. This made up for the lack of in-person cues.</p>
      <p>I was happy to receive feedback. I can pinpoint what problems I have in communicating and what my strengths are so I keep doing them. In terms of weaknesses, I'll keep talking even when I'm researching a topic so my partner knows which point I am in the research. Writing was a little tricky at first, but I soon got the hang of it and it's not too hard anymore. The most difficult part about writing feedback is the negative feedback. I can be tough to think of them since everyone at DBC is super nice, but any type of criticism will only help my partners more. Overall, I'm glad that we pair and it seems super useful. In terms of feedback, it is alright, but not as useful as pairing. I can see how it can be a good accountability tool though.</p>
