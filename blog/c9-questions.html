    <h2>Asking Questions</h2>
    <h4>August 13th, 2015</h4>
    <img src="../img/c9.jpg" alt="Img of Post">
    <p>Many times in development I come to a problem and am stumped. I end up googling or asking a friend if they know the solution. More often than not I end up googling it. Overtime, I've noticed the key to getting a solution is not necessarily where I'm posting the question, but how I post it. I have to structure my question correctly.</p>
    <p>I've come to the conclusion that there are a few ways to ensure I get the correct answer. The first is to do research on the question. Learn all the background of the question I'm asking. I have to understand any concepts I'm asking about so a reader won't be confused. The second step is to true finding the solution myself for more than 5-10 minutes. The key here is by understanding how I'm thinking through this questions, I can discover more specific details that can aid my online help. The third and final trait I noticed was to give examples. Sometimes questions can be asked in a few sentences, but often times if I'm asking for help, it's a complicated problem and I need an example to help elaborate.</p>
    <p>These are a few tips that have helped me in solving my coding problems and I hope to find more.</p>
