      <p>My time with Phase 0 so far has been good. I'm picking up the material pretty well and not getting too caught up with problems.</p>
      <p>This post will cover my learning styles and see if I can pinpoint where to improve with it. My learning style is split between two Gregorc thinking styles: abstract sequential and abstract random. Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. Abstract Sequential Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.</p>
      <p>If I were to pinpoint my biggest struggle, it'd be staying focused reading texts and documentation. It just seems pretty dull. Mixing it with exercises helped though.</p>
      <p>To counteract this, I've tried timeblocking with varying results. I've isolated myself with a timer at the library and that seemed to help though sometimes I can get distracted. I will try some more blocking intervals to see if they work better.</p>
      <p>The other conversation I want to cover is Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset. While I feel I have a strong Growth Mindset, I can improve in a few areas. Specifically, I want to focus on persisting in the face of setbacks. If I struggle with a concept and don't find a solution within and hour, I get discouraged. Retraining my mind to think I can always come back tomorrow and look at topics in a fresh light will be key to developing this mindset's aspect.</p>
