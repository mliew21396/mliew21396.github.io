      <p>Online security is one of the most talked about topics in the news today. You hear of a breach of a major company and sigh that it has happened again. This should not be the case.</p>
      <p>Searching online for why online security is such a problem led me to an interesting <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2936901/data-security/the-landscape-is-changing-in-the-security-technology-industry.html">article</a> by Anil Chakravarthy. He acknowledges that tech is an everchanging field but the industry needs to change the way the views online security measures.</p>
      <p>For the longest time, security has focused on creating "point-solutions" that work for each individual group. For example, the network group will deploy network security tools, while the applications group will deploy application tools, and the end-point group will deploy devices-specific tools. The problem is these solutions are only plugging holes in a dam. They are not looking at where the cracks are spreading.</p>
      <p>Security must now be seen on an enterprise level, where one team isn't just in charge of their area of expertise. Instead of looking at each individual break, the industry must look top down. Define the all-important assets and then work down to each individual component.</p>
      <p>I've worked the last few years for a major healthcare IT company and have seen first-hand how the healthcare industry is a prime example. The focus for many decades has been between payors and providers. This has been proof in that healthcare IT companies have blossomed with an insurance first mindset. But with the recent introduction of the Affordable Care Act, there has been a shift on who really matters, the patient and consumer. This has launched many initatives within the healthcare realm including patient usability, reporting analytics for hospitals, and provider workflows. On top of this, communication exchanges have been created to aid interoperability between hospitals, aka the transfer of the patient chart across the world.</p>
      <p>The example above shows how IT focus is evolving, but how can this be transferred to other industries? Honestly, it depends, but many industries are pointing to similar solutions. Technology has been on a tear in terms of how much data we can now store and collect about everything. Why don't we use this mountain of data?</p>
      <p>I beleive that by on one hand focusing on this top-down approach and on the other utilizing the emergence of big data analytics/security intelligence, online security can be taken to the next level. </p>
