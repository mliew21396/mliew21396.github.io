    <h2>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h2>
    <h4>August 2nd, 2015</h4>
    <img src="../img/t7.jpg" alt="Img of Post">
    <p>When learning Javascript, there are quite a few differences and similarities I noticed. The key to learning javascript, and in reality ruby as well, is distinguishing the differences between the two. Of these, I want to briefly cover Ruby hashes and JavaScript hashes.</p>
    <p>Syntactically, javascript objects look a lot like ruby hashes as can be seen by the code snippets below.</p>
    <pre><code>
  hash = {name: "Mat" } #ruby hash
  puts hash[:name] #prints "Mat"
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code>
  var obj = {name: "Mat" } //js object
  console.log(obj["name"]) //prints "Mat"
    </code></pre>
    <p>Both act as dictionaries where a property is referencing values that can be accessed directly on the object. Pretty cool huh.</p>
    <p>To summarize what I've discovered between Ruby and JavaScript, JS does not restrict access to properties. The scope of JS is a lot rigorous than ruby. It's very easy to have bleeding scope since if you think about it, everything in JS is within functions which means everything outside these functions is a global variable. On the other hand, Ruby can be seen as too strict with encapsulating too much. How to tell the difference? Only time will tell. But one thing I do know is this will take me while to get use to the differences. I'll just need to keep chugging along in the meantime.</p>
