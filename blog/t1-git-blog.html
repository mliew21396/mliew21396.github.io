        My first blog post! It has only been a few days since I started DBC, but the information to learn has been piling up. The material seems to not be much at first glance, but it easy to spend so much time researching and exploring the topics more in depth. I'll try and keep this post to a minimum.

        To give some background, I consider myself pretty techy. I've always had an interest in computers since high school, whether it is building my own computer or hacking around with video game mods. I dibble and dabbled with computers throughout college, and even landed a QA job after college before I realized I wanted to become a developer. This is why I am enrolled with DBC, to make a career out of programming.

        Personally, most of my outside experience has been with windows systems. I see myself as pretty handy with a PC. But after much research, I have decided to dive into DBC with a mac. It'll be a little rough to transition, but the payout from what I hear is really worth it. Excuse me if I mix up windows and mac jargon.

        This first week covers a version control tool, Git and GitHub, as well as the basics of the command line. I've worked with Git before and I can easily say there are many benefits for version control. The easy one is a backup. Who wouldn't want a project's complete history in case of a server breaking down or a harddrive fizzling out? It's a must have. The second big reason is related - you can restore your project to a previous state. If you are working on an enhancement but realize your design is going to break previous existing functionality, you would normally have to sift through the code to remove all your changes. But with version control, you can easily jump back in time to before you added you enhancement and make this design change. My third big reason for version control is collaboration. By hosting your project online, others can comment and give feedback to your code/project. It makes it super easy for people to help you out. This creates an easy to use atmosphere for a team of developers or just contributors wanting to lend a hand.

        As I briefly mentioned earlier, Git/GitHub helps you keep track of changes and store your code. Git/GitHub uses a branching system to manage a project. There is a main branch where a project would have its perfectly safe code project. Everything in here has been verified to work and is safe for people on the internet to see. The cool part about Git is you can create branches or snapshots off the main branch and go to town adding a new functionality or simply fixing errors. When your new branch is proven to work and is finished, you simply merge your branch back into the main branch. This prevents errors you create when building your new functionality from affecting the main branch and everyone else. By giving developers the ability to create their own branches off the main branch, a team can work more efficiently and safely without stepping on each other's toes.
