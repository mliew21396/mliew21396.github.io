        Though it has only been a few days, I'm enjoying the DBC experience. Before starting Phase 0, everything was a little clouded in what is exactly being done. But after reading through this phase and actually seeing the work involved, I'm happy with how I'm learning.

        The video introduced worries I had with DBC. Shereef mentioned two camps of people, those who feel everyone else is ahead of them and they will never catchup and the group who are ahead and are not sure if they'll learn enough. I fall in the camp between these two. I have done my own independent study but am nervous with when will I be good enough? I was glad to hear that everyone moves together as a team and the experience is what you make of it. Hearing my worries outloud was reassuring and made me feel better about the program.
