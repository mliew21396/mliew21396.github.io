    <h2>Resolving Conflict</h2>

    <p>A key to working in a development environment is strong communication with your team. Small misunderstandings can easily snowball into bigger problems down the road. It's better to nip problems in the bud.</p>
    <p>
      I once had a conflict with a roomate over what is acceptable in the living room. I was used to leaving whatever in the living room as long as it was closer to my room. He was to the belief that the living room is communal and we should always keep it clean. He didn't bring it up for a while, but I could tell something was up. We eventually had a sitdown and decided the living room will be communal space. I was fine, I just didn't realize there was a problem since people have different standards of living. Once we solved this, it was all cool down the road since we knew to just bring something up when there's a problem.
