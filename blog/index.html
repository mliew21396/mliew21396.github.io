          <p>In selecting a value, the one that resonates the most with me is accomplishment. I hate to pick the first one on the list, but it really defines me. For me, I feel accomplishment encompasses more than being successful. I gain a sense of purpose when I create something useful. I become pride in the work I just made.

          <p>When learning Javascript, there are quite a few differences and similarities I noticed. The key to learning javascript, and in reality ruby as well, is distinguishing the differences between the two.

          <p>Stereotype threat is when a person feels he is confirming negative stereotypes about his social group. This person can become anxious about a certain stereotype and actually underperform because of this social pressure.</p>
